          Having a sisterhood as tight-knit as ours not only serves as an amazing support system, but also creates memories that will last a lifetime. Our annual sisterhood events include sisterhood retreats, Big/Little reveal, weekly sisterhood events, and much more! We have various 'Deltas Only' events throughout the year to strengthen our sisterhood and explore San Diego! Some events going to a Padres game, photoshoots at pumpkin patches, haunted hayrides, and beach bonfires.

        <div class="sister-body">
           Big &amp; Little Reveal is definitely one of the highlights of the quarter when we do recruitment. Throughout the weekend, new members are showered with clues, treats and gifts from their mystery Bigs. Gifts are delivered in baskets. It’s all fun and excitement as each new member spends all weekend trying to piece together the clues to guess which sister she’ll get to call her Big. 
         </br>
         </br>
           Reveal usually happens after Monday night meeting. Littles received their last basket on Monday which includes a costume for them to wear to reveal. Their big and the big's family line all coordinate their outfits to match the little's costume. It is so amazing to see every little's face light up when their big is revealed. Once every Big &amp; Little pairing is revealed and pictures are taken, all the different family lines go off to celebrate. In the past, we've had some families go to In-N-Out, BJ's, and La Jolla Shores!

        <div class="sister-title">Sisterhood Retreats</div>
        <div class="sister-body">
           Twice a year, our chapter decides to go on a mini get-away with all of our sisters! The first retreat of the year happens right before school starts. This retreat allows for all our returning members to bond with each as we prepare for formal fall recruitment. The second retreat takes place during winter or spring quarer. This trip provides a great opportunity for older Tri Deltas to get to know the new members and share funny stories as they reminisce on their past.

        <div class="sister-body">
           Delta Dates happen throughout the year. Members will ask each other on Delta Dates as way to better know each other and strengthen our sisterhood. Some dates include lunch at the Farmer's Market on campus, coffee at Starbucks, and brunch at the many brunch places in San Diego.
